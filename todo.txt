data collection
- bash seems to be working fine for now but is very brittle and only captures 3 channels
-- discard old data once we trust ES
-- channel list, https://www.siriusxm.com/userservices/cl/en-us/json/lineup/500/client/ump works too, but 600 doesn't.  smells like an API version number
-- are we indexing timestamps correctly? are other types OK?
-- what filters out the channels we don't care about?
- prob should be thread pool; we want the threads to succeed about every 60 seconds (not *run* every 60)
-- so the flow should be
-- fire the pool @ 60 seconds
-- worker wakes, splays
-- asks ES "should I work?" (last success > 60s ago?)
-- if so, work


model
- goal: model as little as possible since this is undocumented API city. or (ick) https://code.google.com/p/pojoxml/
- things in this app's domain:
-- track
-- artist
-- timestamp of sample
-- timestamp of event start
-- "raw", that is the full JSON document object we indexed

pages
- what's playing "now" on each channel (view SXMtimestamp events by channel w/max timestamp)
- when have we heard this artist before (view SXMtimestamp events by artist)

housekeeping
- remove helloworld nature
