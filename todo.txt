model
- goal: model as little as possible since this is undocumented API city. or (ick) https://code.google.com/p/pojoxml/
- things in this app's domain:
-- Play ("what's on now" ~SXM timestamp event)
-- artist
-- timestamp of sample
-- timestamp of event start
-- "raw", that is the full JSON document object we indexed
-- channel model with filtering

pages
- what's playing "now" on each channel (view Play events by channel w/max timestamp)
- when have we heard this artist before (view Play events by artist)

housekeeping
- I suppose it's time for some tests
- add an admin page to clear FTL caches -- https://gist.github.com/dmorgantini/11397642 (and get to the config of FreemarkerViewRenderer)

defer
- the way the webapp connects to the ES cluster feels tightly coupled
